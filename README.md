# NestJS golink

## What
This is a simple Knowledge sharing tool inspired by the Google go/links. It's a resources aggregator where you can define easy to remember links to resources distributed in different places of your organization. For example, suppose you want your new employee to take a look at the organization code-style guide, you can simply send him/her a 'go.to/code-stye' that will point to the desired resources such as a PDF/Drive Document/Video...

## Why
Knowledge sharing is an important investment if you want to reduce the Knowledge/Documentation Debt present in your software. Having a tool that allows you to easier remember and rapidly access knowledge can help you to reduce this debt.

## Description

This project was built with [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework. Now it exposes some simples API to define Links, I will provide also an UI to search for interesting Links so you can find them easier.

> You: But [@dadebulba](https://github.com/dadebulba), why not using NodeJS or PHP or Flask, it would be simpler to implement this project! <br>
> Me: I know, but I wanted to learn something new and I like how NestJS is structured since it's very similar to Angular
